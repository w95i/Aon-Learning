            <b>Lorem IpsumÂ is</b> simply dummy text of the printing and
            typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard
            dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a
            galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has
            survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
            typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in
            the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum
            passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like
            Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum

              There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available,
              but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by
              injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even
              slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem
              Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing
              hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on
              the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making
              this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a
              dictionary of
              <strong>over 200</strong> Latin words, combined with a handful of
              model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks
              reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free
              from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words
              etc..

              Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text.
              It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC,
              making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin
              professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of
              the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum
              passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical
              literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes
              from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et
              Malorum"
              <strong>(The Extremes of Good and Evil)</strong> by Cicero,
              written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics,
              very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem
              Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in
              section 1.10.32.

              The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is
              reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and
              1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also
              reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English
              versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.
